This page lists the materials and the tools that you'll need to build your
own arcade cabinet.  Most things are required, but some things are optional
(and are explicitly mentioned as such.)
	</p><p>
This page details the list that was required to build the authors' own cabinet,
Sideshow Bob. Depending on how closely you follow our design, your own list
might be slightly different.
	</p><p>
This page also includes a list of tools that will be useful. You may not, of
course, be willing to buy many of these tools, since they can be
quite expensive. However, they do make life much easier. If you don't already
have them, then try and find a friend from whom you can borrow them.

	<h1>Materials List</h1>
	<h2>Wood, Steel, and Plastic</h2>
	<p>
First, we present the raw materials list.  For many of the items below, you
have multiple choices (e.g. plywood vs. particle board; paint type; etc.)
Each such item is discussed in detail later on.
	</p><p>
For the most part, these materials can be obtained from your local
home improvement store (e.g. Lowe's or the Home Despot.)
