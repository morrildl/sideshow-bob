                As every right-thinking person knows, video games are cool, and
                arcades rock.  Even supposing that the actual games themselves that
        one finds in an arcade can't compete on a technological level with,
        say, the latest PC games or a console, there is just something
        primordially tactile about a physical piece of equipment, dedicated
        to gaming, that has a certain intrinsic honor.
        </p>
        <p>
         Physical arcades are public places, and the experience of gathering
        with your buddies to have fun and play games, and perhaps challenge
        all comers to best you in digital combat, is one not to be missed.
        </p>
        <p>
        For these reasons, Zteve and I begat a project to build our own
        arcade cabinet.  Well, actually to build <i>me</i> an arcade cabinet
        since Zteve doesn't have room for one of his own.  The general idea
        is to build a piece of furniture into which one places a PC and a
        suitable display device (i.e. monitor or TV) and use it to play games.
        </p>
        <p>
        We can play anything from the latest first-person shooter, to classic
        arcade games.  Really, this creature is just an homage to the Arcade
        Experience and simply adds a certain style and invokes a certain type
        of feeling for the room it's placed in.
        </p>
        <p>
        Anyway, that's all bullshit justification.  The fact is we don't need
        any fscking "justification", so we're just doing it.  So there.

                <h1>Selecting Parts</h1>
                <h2>Controlling ourselves</h2>
                <p>
        First we needed actual arcade parts.  So, I ordered an "Ultimate
        Joystick", and 8 "ultimate Pushbuttons" from <a href="http://www.happcontrols.com/">happ controls.</a>
        That got us started.

            <div class="entry">
                <h1>Getting Input</h1>
                <h2>USB or not USB? That is the question.</h2>
                <p>
        Your average "game pad" is just a small circuit board, with "E"-shaped
        contacts on the board, whose fingers interlace.  When you mash on a
        button, a conducting plate shorts those fingers, and the game pad
        registers a button press.
        </p>
        <p>
        <a href="http://www.saitekusa.com/usa/prod/p150.htm">Here's a typical
        game pad.</a>  pretty straightforward.  <a href="photos/p150-top.jpg">
        Here's that same game pad gutted.</a> <a href="photos/p150-bottom.jpg">
        Here's that same board, from the other side.</a>  You can probably
        make out the points on the board where the buttons would go.
        </p>
        <p>
        With this knowledge, I started to get down to business. I picked up
        one of those controllers just mentioned (obviously,) and soldered
        leads from the joystick's microswitches to the points on the board.
        I suck at soldering, so this was a little something of a challenge
        for me.  Eventually, though, I did get it to work.
        </p>
        <p>
        Now, electrically this worked fine.  However, a guy at work who is
        actually, like, an electrical engineer and has been doing this stuff
        since the dawn of time warned me to be sure that the soldering
        connections were "physically able" to withstand the strain.  I thought
        he was worried about having the connections pop off the board.  I
        was <b>mistaken.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
        No, he was actually worried about the contact pads physically tearing
        off the board, because the solder clings to the pads harder than the
        pads cling to the boards.  Thusly was the P150 lost to me.  I could
        probably have salvaged it, but a better solution presented itself
        anyway.
        </p>
        <p>
        Unfortunately, I didn't get any photos of the P150 wired to the
        joystick.
        </p>
            </div>
            <div class="entry">
      <h1>A Better Solution</h1>
      <h2>Enter the IPAC</h2>
        At this point I figured it was time to check out this
        <a href="http://www.ultimarc.com/">ipac thing</a> I'd heard about.
        Basically, it does everything you could conceivably need it to do,
        and comes with a terminal block to which you attach wires.  It just
        doesn't get any simpler than that. <i>it just doesn't damnit!</i>
        <p>
        So, I ordered an IPAC.  <a href="photos/dcp_0531.jpg">wiring the joystick to it</a> was trivially
        easy, especially since I'd already soldered up the joystick for the
        P150, anyway.

            </div>
            <div class="entry">
      <h1>Ready to Rock</h1>
      <h2>What next?</h2>
        Once I had the IPAC working, it was time to move along, and actually
        start building a prototype.
            </div>

      <h2>A joyful stick</h2>
        <p>
        What's an arcade cabinet without large, shiny, candy-like buttons
        to press that respond with viscerally satisfying tactile
        feedback?  Indeed, it is naught without them, and so it was time to
        wire some buttons up to the IPAC too.
        </p>
        <p>
        The problem with that is that you really can't wire up buttons until
        you've mounted them into some kind of panel.  That meant it was time
        Zteve and I hit the Home Despot and grabbed ourselves some wood-like
        substance to start hacking up.
        </p>
        <p>
        We picked up some medium-density fiberboard (MDF) and then prepared
        a layout for the buttons.  Basically we did this by just putting my
        hand on a piece of paper, marking where my fingers naturally laid, and
        then centering the buttons on those points.  This produced two
        "arcs" of buttons instead of rows.  This might sound strage, but there
        are actually arcade cabinets that have this configuration.  We
        copied this template onto a piece of paper, and prepared to start
        making holes.
        </p>
        <p>
        Zteve brought his tools, and away we went.  <a href="photos/dcp_0532.jpg">first we drilled holes for the joystick.</a> The stick actually includes
        official dimensions for the stick, so we weren't (entirely) shooting
        in the dark on that.
        </p>
            </div>
            <div class="entry">
      <h1>Pushing My Buttons</h1>
      <h2>A sextuplet of holes</h2>
        <p>
        Next, we just took a copy of the button layout template, and taped
        it to the MDF in what seemed like a decent spot, relative to the
        joystick.  Zteve then drilled through the template directly into
        the board.  The paper actually shredded pretty well, so it was
        fortunate that we had the foresight to also mark the center points
        of the buttons with small nail-marks.
        </p>
        <p>
        After drilling the holes, <a href="photos/dcp_0533.jpg">we installed

      <h1>Common Ground</h1>
      <h2>An iron hand</h2>
        <p>
        Since Zteve had not had the "pleasure" of working with a 
        soldering iron recently, I let him make the connections between
        the microswitches on the joystick and buttons.  (Those wires then
        just screw into the IPAC terminal block.)

        <p>

        You can also see the IPAC in that photo, connected to the keyboard and

            <div class="entry">
      <h1>Lessons Learned</h1>
      <h2>Boy, did we botch this</h2>
	<p>
        We actually learned quite a bit from this experience.  Here are some
        random notes, in no particular order.  We will be using these as
        input into the next step, which is an actual attempt to build the
        control box. The rest of the cabinet will follow.
	</p><ul>
        <li>The joystick should probably be rotated about 8 degrees or so
        clockwise, for more comfort.  This means it won't be "square" to the
        way the user is facing the cabinet, but it will be more comfortable
        to use.  We'll just put some kind of marking on the cabinet's surface
        to inform new users of this fact.</li>
        <li>We didn't actually need to solder anything.  In fact, we should
        probably NOT solder anything.  The IPAC already accepts its connections
        via a terminal block, and the buttons' and joystick's switches have flat tabs
        as connectors.  This means that we should be able to use those
        flat "fast-attach connectors" (as I believe Radio Shack calls them)
        to make installation easier, and make replacing parts MUCH easier.
        This means we'll have to undo a non-trivial (but not huge) amount
        of soldering. Oh well.</li>
        <li>It turned out when we installed the buttons that we laid them out
        so that they <i>just barely</i> fit next to each other.  However,
        we didn't realize that the screw-on "nut" that secures the button to
        the board from underneath is wider than the top of the buttons!  As
        a result, it holds together okay for now, but we are going to have
        to spread the buttons out a bit on the final copy. (In the
        photo above, you can especially see this with the red buttons.)</li>
        <li>We used flat-head screws to secure the joystick.  This was a good
        start; however, we need to recess them.  Unfortunately we had no
        counter-sink bit, so right now they are not.  This will be cool, because
        with recessed flat-head screws, we can lay the contact paper right over
        the top of the panel, and the screws won't even be visible at all.
        In most cabinets I've seen, the screw heads are either visible, or
        even worse, and look like they might get irritating after a while.</li>
        </ul>
	<p>
        So, the prototype did exactly what it was supposed to do:  it taught
        us some interesting details.  Now we feel well-equipped to translate
        this information to the "final" (or at least, first cut of the final
        version) of the control panel.
	</p>
        <p>
        Even now, it's already supremely cool.  It's fun to just use the
        prototype board instead of a joystick.  <a href="photos/dcp_0535.jpg">
        Here's Zteve testing the board with Galaga.</a>

    <h1>Selecting a TV</h1>
    <h2>A sordid tale of woe</h2>
        <p>
        After much wishing and washing, I finally elected to go with a TV
        for the display.  I reached this epiphany after Zteve, Will, and I took
        a trip to an arcade, whereupon we realized after some examination
        that basically no modern arcade machine uses a computer monitor; they
        all use TVs.
        </p>
        <p>
        So, I elected to purchase a 25" TV with S-Video input.  Of course,
        this turned out to be difficult to find (apparently most manufacturers
        don't think people who want 25" TVs want S-Video as well) and was
        the source of no small amount of angst and heartache, as I was forced
        to cancel my Barnes &amp; Noble Mastercard, mostly on principle since
        MBNA was being fascist.
        </p>
        <p>
        I still don't actually have my TV, which is irritating.  Apparently
        now there's some kind of trouble with the vendor I bought it from,
        no doubt because they are suspicious of three declined charges
        followed by a successful charge with another card.
        </p>
        <p><b>Pfeh.</b></p>
        <p>
        Oh well, at least I know what I want, and all I have to do is find it.
        </p>
            </div>
            <div class="entry">
    <h1>Selecting a System</h1>
    <h2>A costly decision</h2>
        <p>
        My initial plan had been to use a spare Compaq 450MHz Pentium II I
        have here.  However, after examining it, I have concluded that it is
        unsuitable for my purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
        First of all, it's not a Pentium II; it says that on the case, but
        the system itself says it's a Pentium Pro.  Also, it only has 96MB of
        memory, which is probably inadequate.  Besides that, it weighs 7
        metric tonnes, and has a really obnoxious layout inside the case, with
        no expandability.  So yeah, Compaq sucks.  HP sucks just as much with
        Compaq as they both did separately.
        </p>
        <p>
        So, I had to order a 1.3GHz Athlon, 256MB of memory, semi-cheesy
        NVidia card with TV-out, and a network card.  This cost me actual
        dollars, but at least it'll be way more capable than that shitty-ass
        Compaq.
        </p>
            </div>
            <div class="entry">
    <h1>Updating the Wiring</h1>
    <h2>Rectifying mistakes</h2>
        <p>
        As mentioned earlier, the initial prototype assembly of the control
        panel involved soldering the joints up.  This is the hard way to do
        things, since it makes it difficult to disassemble the panel if you
        need to replace parts.
        </p>
        <p>
        So, I spent some time and (with some difficulty) unsoldered all the
        joints and got the solder largely cleaned off the connector tabs.
        Then I had to go to the local Ripoff Shack and locate some
        fast-disconnect tab terminal connectors.  After a couple false starts
        and another trip to obtain a suitable crimping tool, I was able to
        wire everything up with the new connectors.
        </p>
        <p>
        <a href="photos/dcp_0542.jpg">you can see the results here.</a>
        This technique is highly recommended, and it works well.  I tested
        the re-wired panel, and it continues to work fine.  The only other
        comment I have is be sure to leave yourself plenty of wire when you
        hook these things together;  a couple times I left myself pretty
        tight in terms of space, and had to splice a couple wires as you
        can see in the photo.  Eventually I just began erring on the side
        of excess, which I recommend.  You might lose a little wire, but
        it's better than screwing up a whole chain because you left a single
        segment too short.  (This, obviously, only applies to the common ground
        bus wire.  The actual signal leads are point-to-point and hard to
        screw up.)

        the goods on order.)  It's worthwhile to do a process check.
        </p>
        <p>
        Progress has been frankly slow lately, due to the difficulties I had
        in pulling the equipment together.  Now, however, it's all over but the
        elbow grease.
        </p>
        <p>
        Next up is Configuration Complete.  By this I refer to that coveted
        state in which the whole system will be functioning as I expect it
        to:  i.e. the system will be using the TV as a display, MAME will
        be installed, and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
        That should be straightforward;  however, back to that arse business.
        Zteve and I did some research and discovered that all MAME front-ends
        suck.  Generally, they all assume you have a full keyboard, or
        require an obnoxious full-on desktop environment like KDE or GNOME.
        "Lightweight" apparently never enters into the equation.
        </p>
        <p>
        As a result, Zteve and I are forced to write the Arcade ROM Selection
        Environment -- ARSE.  The source for this creature will go up once
        we have something that kind of mostly works.  It is being written in
        ncurses, for simplicity;  I intend to just slap it up in a gigantic
        xterm, more or less instead of an X window manager.
        </p>
        <p>
        Excluding ARSE, I expect to be Configuration Complete this week, with
        luck.  So far the biggest configuration chore was getting Red Hat 8
        installed, but that's now behind me.  Everything else should be
        ready to rock.... hopefully.

    <h1>Well, Not Quite</h1>
    <h2>Getting there</h2>
        <p>
        After a hiatus of some weeks (due to various illnesses, vacations,
        and holidays on Steve's and my parts,) we finally made some good
        progress this week.  We're not quite configuration complete, but
        we're getting there.  The following sections summarize our status.
        </p>
            </div>
            <div class="entry">
    <h1>ARSE-Monster Steve</h1>
    <h2>A true software virtuoso</h2>
        <p>
        Steve has taken our rough design for ARSE and actually implemented a
        prototype.  Here's his status, in his own words.
        </p>
        <p/>
<p>
<big><b>ARSE 0.00001</b></big>
</p>
<p>
        As Dan had mentioned before, pretty much every arcade ROM selector
we found was either too presumptuous or severely broken. By presumpuous I
mean wanting keyboard and mouse and usually, GTK. By severely broken I
mean, well, even after massaging the Makefile and fiddling with bits of
code, completely non-operational.
</p>
<p>
        So, on a few scraps of paper, ARSE was born. (Gotta hand it to Dan
for the bitchin' acronym...) We were guided by two basic principles,
simple interface and no GUI.
</p>
<p>
        You want a simple interface first off for ease of use. It
shouldn't take more than a few taps on the joystick to get to the game you
want to play. Second of all, our input options are severely limited,
basically just the joystick and a few buttons.
</p>
<p>
        As for the GUI, Sideshow Bob's guts consist of a fairly stripped
down RedHat install, no room for big fancy window managers. (No ARSE does
NOT need to do transparency...) However, I happen to be a big fan of
ncurses. I think it's fun to work with and it produces some decent looking
output.
</p>
<p>
        With those two thoughts in mind, the plan for ARSE came together.
We'd have two areas on the screen. The top is the input area. It contains
a set of alphanumeric characters that can be selected using a joystick
controlled cursor. Think of how you enter your initials into an arcade
game. (Tap, tap, tap, "S", tap, tap, "E", tap, tap, tap, tap "Z"...) This
allows you to spell out the first few letter of the game name you want to
play.
</p>
<p>
        The second area is a large, scrollable list of the games. As you
select letters in the input area, ARSE appropriately selects the ROMs
whose names match the key from the input area. I've found that with the
current list of MAME ROMS (about 3600), it only takes about 3 characters
before you're down to something less than 20 ROMS. This makes it much
easier to select the ROM you want to play. So, with a little joystick
jockeying and about 5 or 6 button presses, you're at your favorite game.
</p>
<p>
<big><b>The Prototype</b></big>
</p>
<p>
        With this in mind, Dan and I broke up the work. I would work on
the ROM sorting/selection piece while he worked on the ncurses layout. Dan
scored first and got a basic ncurses app running that presented two
windows on the screen. (And even printed "Hello" in them...what a
codewizard) This was checked into the ARSE CVS repository for my perusal.
A few days later, I started hacking together a basic ROM sorter. Lemme
tell you, I believe in the STL now more than ever. The rom_sort program
just parsed a text file of ROM names, checked the path to the available
ROMs, threw them in a vector, and away you go. After some user defined
sort routines, I had a program that could take in a key and down-select to
the set of ROMs that started with that key.
</p>
<p>
        Everything was going great, well, until I got mono. That required
me to sit around the house in a feverish stupor for about 2 weeks.
However, at times, I did get the hankering to play with some ncurses, so I
stole Dan's part and started building up the ncurses interface. I took his
base and started throwing together the prototype.  After a few hours of
coding, I had a functional ncurses interface that let you punch in rom
names and switch between input and list areas.
</p>
<p>
        So, after I recovered, Dan and I resumed our regular SSB meetings.
At the last one, I finally bit the bullet and frankensteined the rom_sort
code with the arse prototype interface. Amazingly enough, after a few
unholy acts of code (which I won't go into being an embarrased software
engineer) ARSE Version 0.00001 works. It allows a user to type in a ROM
name and select from a ROM list that matches the input key. I just need to
add an spawn() statement to fire off an appropriate UNIX command.
</p>
<p>
        Enhancements to the prototype will include only displaying the
ROMs that the user actually has (in the roms/ directory) and making a
properties file so a user can tailor ARSE to their system. But so far, so
good.
</p>

    <h1>Administrivia</h1>
    <h2>We love you, OpenGL!</h2>
        <p>
        The primary problem as of the last update was that xmame looked like,
        well, ass (and I don't mean ARSE.)  I had X running and so on, but
        xmame in plain old X11 mode -- even with DGA -- just didn't have great
        image quality.
        </p>
        <p>
        After some searching, the XGL driver for MAME looked promising. So,
        I tried hacking the xmame RPM to enable XGL mode, with little success.
        I ran into some obnoxious Makefile issues.  After futzing with it
        for a little while, I decided to search for pre-built RPMs of xmame
        with the XGL driver.
        </p>
        <p>
        I then did what I should have done in the first place, and checked
        <a href="http://freshrpms.net">freshrpms.net</a>.  All hail the
        almighty freshrpms.net!  They had pre-built MAME RPMs... with XGL
        versions... for Red Hat 8.0.  Rock on!!
        </p>
        <p>
        Getting XGL xmame running was a big win.  Looks great (it's
        antialiased,) it can automagically do best-fit scaling, and can run
        in full-screen mode.  At this point, I consider MAME ready to go.
        </p>
        <p>
        Next step is to configure the system -- i.e. get X to start on boot,
        configure it to run ARSE in an xterm, etc.  That's my current activity
        while Steve cleans up ARSE.
        </p>
        <p>
        At this point many of the details are pretty minor and straightforward.
        Rather than detail them all here, I've created <a href="todo.jsp">a
        separate task list page</a>.  That will reflect our current status.

    <h1>Special Thank-You</h1>
    <h2>Shout-out to my man Mike</h2>
        <p>
        Good old Mike has been a participant in spirit, if not in body, since we
        started this thing. He may even be the first to clone this puppy, so
        that Sideshow Bob has a sister system in Florida.
        </p>
        <p>
        Recently Mike provided me with a vital piece of the system. It is
        not a stretch to say that we would be in a tight situation if not for
        Mike.
        </p>
        <p>
        So, to thank Mike, <a href="http://www.zthing.com/zthings/yesmen">

      <h1>Chapter 6b: Configuration Complete</h1>
            <div class="entry">
    <h1>Major Milestone</h1>
    <h2>A great piece of ARSE</h2>
        <p>
        Today, Steve put in a bit of code that lets ARSE execlp() a shell
        script.  I then installed this on SSB, tweaked the script to actually
        run MAME, and... oh my god.
        </p>
        <p>
        <i>It works.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
        It's not perfect;  it needs color and other prettying up, but overall
        it is doing what we need.  You fire up ARSE, it shows you a list of
        games, you enter letters to downselect the list, and then select
        the game you want to play.  Whack enter and.... there you are.  Hit
        ESC, and you bomb out to ARSE.
        </p>
        <p>
        I, meanwhile, have not been idle. I now have X all set up (xinit
        starts up an xterm with huge fonts for readability, etc.) and this
        even starts up automatically on runlevel 5 via init.  With a trivial
        tweak, I can even get the xterm to jump directly into ARSE!
        </p>
        <p>
        With a few minor tweaks, I would boldly claim that Sideshow Bob is
        complete -- if we were willing to tolerate having a keyboard attached.
        However we're not, so we have to make some additional tweaks to it.
        </p>
        <p>
        Oh man... this is amazing.  It's <i>real</i> now.  We're so close I
        can taste it....
        </p>
            </div>
            <div class="entry">
    <h1>Next Steps</h1>
    <h2>Not quite there yet</h2>
        <p>
        So, what now?  Aside from Steve's "code hygiene" work, we have a few
        things to work out still.  Mostly this is <a href="todo.jsp">recorded
        on the todo list</a> but it is useful to outline a few major points
        here.
        </p>
	<ul>
        <li>improvements to arse (add color, remap keys to joysticks, etc.)</li>
        <li>Add a frankensteined game pad so we can have 3 extra buttons for
            ESCape-to-ARSE from w/in MAME, sound mute, and game pause</li>
        <li>Add a frankensteined Radio Shack universal remote so we can power
            on the TV (and shut it off) from the system unit</li>
        <li>build a cabinet of wood and steel (and a little plastic)</li>
        <li>resolve some bugs in mame (currently mame crashes a lot. doh.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        At this point I expect the bottleneck to be the cabinet;  we pretty
        much know exactly what we have to do to get the rest working. Man...
        we seem to be getting close.

      <h1>Chapter 6c: Configuration Complete</h1>
            <div class="entry">
    <h1>For Real</h1>
    <h2>Basically There</h2>
        <p>
        We made some good progress recently, and we're almost there. At the most
        recent SSB meeting, Steve improved ARSE some and I worked on getting
        the system to boot directly into ARSE.  Both are now working quite
        well, and I'm going to declare Configuration Complete.
        </p>
        <p>
        That leaves us with largely 2 tasks: polishing off some miscellaneous
        details, and physically building the cabinet.  For the cabinet, Steve
        and I have set aside a weekend during which we will simply... build the
        cabinet.  The next section discusses some of the miscellaneous details
        we have taken care of, and that still remain.  Mostly this is an
        elaboration of the todo list.

            </div>
            <div class="entry">
    <h1>Miscellania</h1>
    <h2>Driving me insania</h2>
        <p>
        Once we got the TV, computer, ARSE, and MAME largely working together,
        details started presenting themselves to us.
        </p>
        <p>
        First, we realized that we need to somehow turn the TV on and off
        with the system. TVs aren't monitors and so don't do things like Energy
        Star DPMS power management.  Consequently we need a way for the PC to
        turn the TV on during its boot cycle. (We could always just keep the
        remote handy and do it ourselves, but that's a cop-out.) Ultimately we
        decided to go buy a cheap universal remote and hack it up, so that
        we can trigger its "power" button via a signal sent from the parallel
        port to a transistor wired to the power button's contacts inside the
        remote.  That still remains to be done.
        </p>
        <p>
        Another thorny related problem is how we turn the PC itself on and off.
        The problem is that it is an ATX system, meaning that when you shut the
        system down it turns off the power supply, and the only way to turn it
        back on is to hit the power button.  This is difficult if the PC is
        inside a big wooden cabinet. Initially we'd intended to try and disable
        or bypass ATX and control power externally with a power strip and use
        a "big red button" wired to the interrupt-generating pin of the
        parallel port to shut down the system.  However, we realized that we
        could just invoke shutdowns from within ARSE, which is much cleaner.
        Moreover, Mike then pointed out that there is a pair of pins on the
        motherboard that the case power switch connects to, and that we could
        simply replace the case power switch with an external button. I then
        wired up a standard arcade button to these 2 pins on the motherboard,
        and it works perfectly. We will simply install this "Big Red Button"
        on the exterior of the cabinet, say on the side somewhere.
        </p>
        <p>
        The IPAC happily does chording, which makes it easy for us to hit the
        ESCAPE key to bomb out of MAME back to ARSE.  However, we discovered
        that we can't remap ARSE to use the same keycodes that the IPAC and
        MAME use by default, because some of them are keydown/keyup events
        on meta characters (such as left control) that ncurses simply doesn't
        ever see.  So, Steve is going to remap keys and then we'll have to
        tweak the IPAC and MAME accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
        Once we have the remote control issue working, all we will have to do
        is build the cabinet.  However, then we have to <i>paint</i> and
        otherwise decorate the cabinet -- notably, we'll need art for the
        marquee on the cabinet. This was a bit of a pickle, since neither
        Steve nor I has much artistic talent.  Fortunately, Aimee's Mom
        works as a graphic designer, and she kindly agreed to help us out!
        so here's a big shout-out to aimee's mom! Sideshow Bob lives!
        </p>
        <p>
        None of the issues above prevent us from having a functional system;
        they're mostly just convenience.  As a result, I am declaring
        Sideshow Bob officially configuration complete!

        It strikes me at this point how indebted I am on this project to the
        people who have been helping me out.  It's almost like a community
        project, now: Steve, of course, has been my partner all along;

      <h1>Chapter 7: Cabinet Construction Begins</h1>
            <div class="entry">
    <h1>Making Dreams a Reality...</h1>
    <h2>...with power tools</h2>
	<p>
        Steve and I had an All-Holy Build the Arcade Cabinet, Already
        Weekend&trade; yesterday and today.  We started out by reviewing the
        plans we got from
        <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~seanhat/arcade/arcade.htm">lusid</a>
        and coming up with a task order of assembly and working out some of
        the smaller details, like precisely how we are going to mount the
        control box onto the cabinet, etc.  We went through a bunch of options,
        such as hinges, such as hinges, carriage bolts, cleats, removable
        screws, etc., but finally settled on these details:
	</p>
	<ul>
        <li>Due to weight and materials availability considerations, we are
        using 5/8" particle board instead of MDF to build the bulk of the
        cabinet; the control panel top is still MDF for "texture" reasons</li>
        <li>Particle board doesn't paint quite as well as MDF, so we will be
        using a deep glossy latex-based paint for the cabinet.</li>
        <li>the control panel box <i>must</i> be removable; otherwise the
        finished cabinet will be 34" inches wide which is too wide to fit
        through many doorways. (The cabinet excluding the control panel is
        only 27.5" wide.)</li>
        <li>The control panel box will be screwed down onto a 2x4 segment
        mounted in the cabinet (vs. screwed into the ends of the particle
        board.</li>
        <li>The monitor support inside the cabinet on which the TV will rest
        will be supported by 2x4 segments forming cleats or rails on which
        most of the TV's weight will rest (vs. screwing the ends of the support
        directly into the walls of the cabinet, which would be less strong.)</li>
        <li>The top of the control panel will be attached to the rest of the
        control box via steel L-brackets mounted at the corners. (We considered
        hinging the top and including locking brackets of some kind, but
        eventually abandoned that since it was a lot of work/silliness for
        something that you're not even going to do that often.)</li>
        <li>The construction of the bulk of the cabinet will be done by
        biscuit joints so as to avoid any visible external hardware (i.e.
        screws) and for durability.</li>
        <li>T-molding will be used on all visible edges of the cabinet
        except the control panel, which will be rounded-edged via router for
        comfort.</li>
        </ul>
	<p>
        Otherwise, we are following LuSiD's plans pretty closely.  Steve has
        an AutoCAD drawing of the cabinet which we are treating as the
        official plans, and are working from paper while down in the dusty
        basement.
	</p>
            </div>
            <div class="entry">
    <h1>Let It Begin</h1>
    <h2>Sawdust is afoot</h2>
        <p>
        Once we had the plans worked out, we started the actual construction.
        Essentially, the design requires around two and a half 4'x8' sheets
        of 5/8" wood (for which we are using particle board.)  However, we
        needed to buy 3 full sheets since there is a bunch of scrap that you
        end up with after you cut out pieces.  Since we decided to do the
        control panel top with 1/2" MDF (so that we can router the edge), we
        actually have quite a bit more extra particle board area than LuSiD's
        plans would normally have yielded us.  That was nice since it provided
        us a very comfortable amount of breathing room.
        </p>
        <p>
        Construction began in my dad's basement. He has a very nice selection
        of tools, two of which are <i>highly recommended</i> if not imperative
        for a project like this:  a circular saw, and a table saw.  If you
        don't have a table saw you can probably get away with a circular saw,
        but you really want a table saw if you can at all get one; it makes
        life much, much easier.
        </p>
        <p>
        So far we've cut up two of the 4' x 8' sheets, and have a pile of
        parts.  In the next few days, we'll cut up the last sheet, and then
        begin assembling the parts.  Assembly will most likely take us some
        time, because we'll be using biscuited joints for strength;  it will
        certainly take us longer than it might have if we were using screws.
        You can't rush quality, I guess.

        One thing that's become apparent is that this fscker is going to be
        <i>heavy.</i>  It's not as heavy as it would have been with MDF, but
        it's not going to be that much lighter either. This is not the kind
        of thing that you're going to want to move around on a whim. Besides
        that, we ended up deciding not to make it "disassembleable."  I simply
        don't forsee myself ever taking it apart, even to move;  I'll take
        the TV and computer out, of course, but I don't see how dismantling
        the cabinet really buys you that much.  Hopefully, though, using the
        particle board and thinner 5/8" material will keep things manageable.

    <h1>Other Updates</h1>
    <h2>Unannounced progress</h2>
        <p>
        There are a few other issues that haven't yet been discussed here.
        I'll take care of them now.
        </p>
        <p>
        We have altered the scheme for remote control/powering on the TV
        again.  We realized that using a universal remote -- even one hacked
        to take power from an external source and with the power button wired
        to the parallel port, etc. -- was just too clumsy to use reliably.
        We looked around for a more robust solution and found 
        <a href="http://www.lirc.org/">the lirc project</a>.  That site
        includes a schematic for building an infrared transmitter circuit,
        which we will use with LIRC to turn on the TV directly from the host
        computer, using the DTR signal of the RS232 port.  We intend to
        essentially tape an IR LED on top of the IR sensor on the TV, with the
        rest of the circuit wired to the serial port.
        It should be quite cool; no intermediate remote required.
        </p>
        <p>
        Steve has been working diligently on ARSE, and has improvements that
        I haven't yet installed on the SSB hardware.  I need to do that soon.
        </p>
        <p>
        We are planning to put together a "distribution" of everything
        SSB-related (probably on SourceForge) for others to read and perhaps
        make use of.  This will likely included a detailed measured drawing of
        our plans, Steve's AutoCAD model, system configuration data (e.g.
        my X configuration, init scripts, etc.), and ARSE.

    <h1>Mad Props</h1>
    <h2>We couldn't do it without ya...</h2>
        <p>
        Earlier I referred to various power tools. Actually, I merely
        <i>wish</i> I owned those tools.  In point of fact, my dad does, and
        we're just using his.
        </p>
        <p>
        Actually, aside from lending us his tools, my dad is also doing a lot
        of the actual woodworking, since he's better at it than me (at least;
        I don't know about Steve. :) So, this is a shout-out to our own
        Master Carpenter, Dad!

    <h1>Steps Forward, Steps Back</h1>
    <h2>From preparation to assembly</h2>
        <p>
        Steve and I had a couple more assembly sessions since the last time
        I updated.  As of today, we now have the bulk of the cabinet assembled.
        We still have a few things to do, but we generally know how to do
        them and can take care of them in pretty short order.</p>
        <p>
        By way of both explanation and illustration, here are some links.
        Generally, one needs only review the plans for the cabinet linked to
        earlier, and consult with these pictures for illustration of various
        steps.</p>

        </ul>
        <p>
        It's worthwhile to discuss some construction notes, and a few snafus
        we ran into.  Here they are in no particular order.
        </p>
        <ul>
        <li>
        <p>
        We cut the t-molding slot before we assembled the cabinet, since it
        would be unwieldy (at best) to try and do a thing like that after we'd
        already assembled the thing.  However, it wasn't until we were well
        into that I suddenly realized that the t-molding slot and biscuit slots
        intersect one another.  That's a major problem, since the t-molding and
        biscuits obtruct each other.
        </p>
        <p>
        We can only conclude that no one else has done a biscuit installation
        with these plans, or at least no one that we know of. At any rate, our
        plan is to assemble the cabinet, and then do a quick clean-up pass with
        the router to re-cut the t-molding slot.  Since we will be taking out
        material from the biscuits, we are now slightly worried about the
        structural integrity of the case, with compromised biscuits.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li>To ameliorate the compromised-biscuit issue, we installed
            glue-blocks in the interior corners of the cabinet. A glue-block
            is simply a piece of scrap wood that you glue on two sides and
            secure into the inside of a corner to increase strength.  We also
            secured the blocks with metal brads as well as glue.
        </li>
        <li>We have not yet installed the monitor shelf and speaker shelf. We
            are going to handle that last, securing them from the outside with
            either screws or brads.  We just think it will be easier to do that
            (since it's already going to be tricky enough) without having to
            worry about biscuiting the things, having to deal with the rest of
            the cabinet not being stable, etc.
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        All in all, it's coming together nicely. I have already ordered the
        bar stools that are to go along with the cabinet, since we're so
        close.  My dad has a shop stool at the same height as the stools I
        ordered (30 inches) and so I gave it a try;  it's damn near perfect.
        I think it's really going to be great to sit on some stools with a
        buddy and play classic arcade games for untold hours.
        </p>
        <p>
        Woo hoo!!  I can taste it, damnit!

            <div class="entry">
    <h1>Next Steps</h1>
    <h2>Now what?!</h2>
        <p>
        There isn't much left, and it's almost to the point where we're getting
        down to brass tacks. (Well, there is no brass in this construction,
        but I suppose someone might use some brass in their own cabinet. :)
        Here is a list of things that remain to be done in roughly the order
        they need to be done.
        </p>
        <ul>
        <li>The base is assembled, but must be installed into the bottom of the
            cabinet carcass</li>
        <li>finalize a template for control layout on the control
            panel, and then drill the holes
        </li>
        <li>round off the edges of the control panel top
        </li>
        <li>drill a hole in the back of the control panel for the
            keyboard cable that will run to the computer
        </li>
        <li>drill a hole in the side of the control panel, where
            we will install a button wired to the ATX power header, to turn
            the thing on and off.
        </li>
        <li>install L-brackets to fasten control box to cabinet carcass
        </li>
        <li>install L-brackets to fasten control panel top to control box
        </li>
        <li>drill a hole in the back of the cabinet itself for the
            power cord
        </li>
        <li>position and install the speaker shelf
        </li>
        <li>position and install the monitor shelf, with probably
            2 crossmembers for strength.  (The design is going to be 2 1x4s
            mounted to the insides of the cabinet that will function as "rails"
            on which the monitor shelf will sit, with 2 cross-members between
            them acting as stiffeners to prevent the shelf from sagging. The
            arrangement will be similar to the cabinet base.)
        </li>
        <li>The cabinet has to be painted; we are currently leaning toward
            probably a black matte, with most likely two coats and a
            primer to get a good finish over the rather rough particle board
        </li>
        <li>install the t-molding (after painting)
        </li>
        <li>install/assemble electronics (i.e. TV and computer) and wiring
        </li>
        <li>work with Aimee's mom on the marquee artwork
        </li>
        <li>figure out a bezel solution (ideally, plexiglass across the whole
            screen with some kind of border; perhaps work with Aimee's mom
            again?)
        </li>
        <li>consider side art
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        There are also a number of software-related kinks that still remain;
        however, these are generally <a href="todo.jsp">covered in the todo
        list</a> so I am not repeating them here.  Notably, the XGL MAME driver
        crashes on certain games, and I need to test the latest version to
        see if it's fixed.  There is also a smattering of work that needs to
        be done on ARSE.
        </p>
        <p>
        Overall, things are starting to come together.  We've been following
        a greedy algorithm in doing this:  we keep iterating, adding new things
        that pop up to our list of tasks.  Until now that list has always been
        growing, and we never knew how much else still lied in wait for us.
        Now, though, I feel like that list has stopped growing, and we can now
        start picking them off one by one until.... we're finished.  At least
        now we have a concrete list of exactly what remains, and we can start
        ticking things off it quickly.

		<h1>Nearing Completion</h1>

			nailed and variously screwed, and the control panel top
			has been laid out and drilled.  First, some photos, and
			then some comments.

		</ul>
		<p><big><b>Monitor Shelf</b></big><br/>
			Because the TV is pretty heavy, we elected to augment
			LuSiD's original design (which called for simply nailing
			the monitor shelf to the sides of the cabinet) with a
			stiffener H-style arrangement for the shelf to sit on.
			We think this is just better structurally since it should
			prevent the shelf from sagging over time.  To secure it,
			we glued and brad-nailed the H-structure together, positioned
			it at the desired angle (which we determined to be between 11 and
			25 degrees for best viewing) according to taste, and then glued
			and brad-nailed the monitor shelf on top of it.
		</p>
		<p>
			We also traced out the footprint of the TV onto the monitor shelf
			before installing it.  After getting the physical measurements
			of the TV (i.e. height at the front and back) we were able to
			verify that it all would fit into the cabinet before we permanently
			nailed or glued anything;  it would suck to find that the TV won't
			fit in after we've finished building the creature.
		</p>
		<p>
			As a final comment, we chose the viewing angle of the TV (i.e. the
			slope of the monitor shelf) according to two criteria:  how it
			looks while standing, and while sitting.  I intend to use this thing
			with a couple 30" high bar stools, so it needs to be playable in
			both configurations.  We put the TV probably somewhere around
			15 - 20 degrees off vertical.
		</p>
		<p><big><b>Control Panel</b></big><br/>
			The next step was to lay out the controls on the control panel.
			This was what we refer to -- in highly technical jargon --
			as a "pain in the ass."  Basically it's not only detailed and
			tedious, it's subjective.  You have to be very careful to get
			it right the first time, because if you get it wrong you have to
			do it all over again, and there are 26 holes you have to drill
			and a ton of measurements to make before drilling to make one of
			these.
		</p>
		<p>
			To position the hardware, we first computed the measurements of
			the interior of the control box, and drew those lines on top of
			the control panel top as a sort of "out of bounds" line, so that
			we had a visual cue as to how much real estate we actually have
			to work with. Then we cut out two pieces of paper on which we
			drew the center points of the control hardware -- i.e. it marked
			the positions of buttons and the stick.  We laid out the buttons
			and stick for one player's "station" on the paper, then traced
			it to a second piece of paper, and then slid those around on
			the control panel top until we were happy with positioning.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once we had the papers in place, we made sure they were symmetrically
			placed and then taped them down.  We marked the center-points of the
			various holes to be drilled onto the wood itself by whacking the point
			of a nail through the paper.  After that, we just drilled.
		</p>
		<p><big><b>Button Layout Tips</b></big><br/>
			The trick to laying out the buttons is to know the minimum distance
			apart you can place them without having their rings underneath collide.
			This turns out to be 1 3/8".  You could just line up the buttons in
			a straight-up grid, separating them by 1 3/8", but we wanted a more
			natural layout, with the center buttons slightly above the other four,
			to match the natural lengths of your fingers.
		</p>
		<p>
			When we installed the buttons, we used this trick to make a template:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>draw a line about 4 inches long with a straight-edge</li>
			<li>draw a line perpendicular to the first line, about a half-inch
			    in from the left</li>
			<li>draw a second line parallel to the first line (and perpendicular
			    to the second line) 1 3/8" above the first line</li>
			<li>on the bottom line, draw a point about an inch or so away from
			    the vertical line; this is the center point of the lower-left
			    button</li>
			<li>draw a point directly above the first point, but on the top line;
			    this is the top-left button</li>
			<li>measure in 2 7/8" from the first (bottom-left) line and make a
			    second point;  this is the bottom-right button</li>
			<li>directly above that point on the top line, make another mark;
			    this is the top-right button</li>
			<li>bisect the two parallel lines, and draw a second vertical line
			    along the bisection</li>
			<li>measure up this new line 1/4" and make a mark;  this is the
			    bottom-middle button</li>
			<li>measure up 1/4" along the midline from the top line, and make the
			    final mark for the top-middle button</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Those steps will get you a decent map for the button layout.
			It'll be clearer once you do the drawing;  it's really quite simple.
			After you've positioned the buttons on the paper, you can position
			the center-point for the control stick to taste.  If you screw it
			up, just start over with a new sheet of paper -- that's why you use
			paper instead of drawing on the wood.
		</p>
		<p><big><b>Making Cuts</b></big><br/>
			Once you have everything laid out and marked, you just have to
			drill the holes.  We recommend taking this very slowly, and being
			very cautious;  "Measure twice, cut once" as Norm Abram says.
			We quickly got tired of this;  it is pretty tedious to drill 26
			holes in succession, carefully measuring each one.  This is probably
			the trickiest part of the whole cabinet-making operation, though,
			so stay the course and make sure you get a quality product.
		</p>
		<p><big><b>Control Stick Notes</b></big><br/>
			The four holes for the control sticks' bolts were drilled with a
			counter-sink bit so that flat-head screw-bolts can be used to secure
			the things while maintaining a perfectly flat playing surface.
			We actually did these <i>after</i> laying out and drilling
			everything else, because we weren't sure how to lay them out. There
			are basically two choice: machine-oriented or player-oriented.  The
			difference is this:  when you expect the players to stand at a slight
			angle to the machine and put the buttons at that angle, do you have
			the left-right axis of the stick be aligned with the angle the player
			stands at (i.e. the player's right is the stick's right) or aligned
			with the cabinet itself (i.e. the game's right is the stick's right.)
			This is one for the ages, and is a matter of taste.  We chose
			player-oriented controls.

			Once everything else was done, we drilled the four holes along
			the top for the Player 1/Player 2 coin/start buttons by positioning
			them 1" in from the top "out of bounds" line, and spacing them 2"
			apart from each other.
		</p>
		<p>
			The only thing remaining to be done is that we have to drill a
			hole in the side of the box (under the lip of the panel top)
			for the button that will be wired to the ATX header on the computer
			motherboard.  We already drilled the hole through the back of the
			case for the PS/2 keyboard cable that will connect the IPAC to the
			computer.

		After a few weeks' worth of evening and weekend time, the
		cabinet is now <b>finished!</b>  That is, it's assembled,
		painted, and trimmed with the t-molding.  This took some time
		since we had to do three coats (primer and 2 topcoats) and you
		have to let it dry in between.  However, it's now finished,
		and it looks great!  Check out the Feast of Pictures below.

		There isn't much else to say;  painting isn't exactly rocket
		science.  There are a few comments we can make, though.
		</p><p>
		First, a quick note on how we attached the control box to the
		cabinet. Over the course of all this, we considered everything
		from hinges to L-brackets to elaborate hook-and-clasp
		mechanisms, but in the end settled on something quite simple.
		As you can see in the first photo above, we just attached blocks
		to the bottom of the control box top (using brads from above,
		and glue) and then simply insert those blocks into the box
		structure, and then screw through the sides of the box into
		the blocks. (The box itself attaches to the cabinet via a
		similar technique.)  This is easily accomplished by simply
		screwing the blocks into the side of the control box
		<i>first</i>, and then (carefully) bradding and gluing the
		panel onto the blocks, and then unscrewing the blocks for
		removal.  That way you have a good solid fit.  It turns out
		that we probably don't even need to screw the box into the
		cabinet, since friction holds it so well on its own.  The
		panel top will have to be screwed in place, though, since there
		is some lateral play front-to-back.
		</p><p>
		We did use quite a few brads on this little creation. We had
		assumed that when we painted it, the brad marks would be
		invisible.  It turns out that they're not.  By carefully
		applying paint to at least reduce visibility, we have
		something we're happy with, but the marks are still visible
		if you look.  If we were to do it again we would try and fill
		them with wood putty, as we did the screw holes for the
		monitor shelf.  However, it's not a major defect.
		</p><p>
		Otherwise, that's pretty much it.  There are still a few small
		details we have to take care of:  we are going to add some
		shiny -- er, blinged out -- aluminum moldings on the kick plate
		front and the sides along the bottom to prevent chipping and
		similar damage, and we have to physically install the monitor
		restraint bracket so that the TV doesn't slide around on the
		shelf.  (This will be a small block of wood on the floor of the
		monitor shelf that the TV rests against.)  We also have to
		whip out a little gaffer's tape to cover over a few gaps between
		boards on the back, and prevent light leakage.  These are very
		minor, however.
		</p><p>
		There is also the matter of artwork, of course:  we need a
		marquee at the top, and we are also thinking about ways to
		get some nicely-decorated artwork for a lucite or plexiglass
		bezel that we want to install in front of the TV screen for a
		nice professional look.  So, it's time to talk to our artist
		again -- Aimee's Mom, Debbie! (Hi, Debbie! :)
		</p><p>
		And so... I formally declare Construction Complete! The
		computer for its part also is working quite well right now,
		so we will just have to pop the box in, pop the TV in, and
		wire the puppy up, and it's Game On -- literally! Yee ha!

		<h1>Sideshow Bob Lives!</h1>
		<h2>A Legend is Born.</h2>
		<p>
		Once we had the cabinet finished, Steve and I got the thing
		moved and installed in its new home. In a not-quite-marathon
		push (and thanks to the local Chinese delivery restaurant),
		we then got the whole thing assembled, wired, and... working.
		</p><p>
		The thing works!  Sideshow Bob lives!  Check out these photos:

		</ul>
		<p>
		There really isn't a great deal more to say.  I've already
		commented on the wiring, the stools, and the cabinet.  This
		was literally just putting it all together.
		There are a few things that are worth mentioning though.
		</p><p>
		First, the paint.  I chose an eggshell/satin finish for the
		paint, primarily because of the texture it provides.  Indeed,
		the texture is excellent and does feel like an actual arcade
		cabinet.  However, it's standard wall paint, and is not very
		durable.  It got rather easily scuffed in the move.  Also,
		that finish is still somewhat porous, making it feel tacky
		on the control panel surface.  Were I to do this again, I would
		absolutely choose to use an enamel finish, and as durable a
		paint as I can find.
		</p><p>
		The only other thing to mention is the aluminum molding at the
		bottom.  Steve and my dad strongly recommended this as a way
		to protect the bottom edges so that they don't chip too badly,
		especially at the toe kick plate area.  I didn't think that
		was necessary, but it can't hurt and I agreed that it might
		also look nice.  In point of fact, it looks <i>fantastic</i>,
		and I highly recommend using it.  In fact, if I were to do it
		again I might look for even more tasteful places to put it.
		Another alternative might be to have used the shiny "chromed"
		t-molding that you can get, instead of the black.  That might
		also have looked awesome.
		</p><p>
		As is clearly evident from the photos, we still need artwork
		for the marquee and bezel, and the fluroescent light for the
		marquee backlight.  We also have yet to do the IR remote
		control transmitter circuit that we will use to turn the TV
		on and off.
		</p><p>
		However, none of that is especially difficult, and it's only
		a matter of time at this point. As a result, I don't think
		there is any reason to update this page again.  Steve and I
		have discussed putting this whole project up on Sourceforge
		(which would involve Steve's AutoCAD drawing, the ARSE source
		code, and a HOWTO which would most likely be a heavily-editted
		revision of this log.)  I think I'll just rely on that for
		any future info.
		</p><p>
		So... I guess that's it for this space.  Wow, what a great
		project.  <i>Vive le Sideshow Bob!</i>
